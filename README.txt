ABOUT
-----

Drupal comes with the blog module, which creates multi-user blogs, one for each
user and one aggregate blog. But many websites only need a single blog.

The "single blog" module re-creates some of the functionality of the blog
module, but re-purposed for a single blog that uses Drupalâ€™s default article
content type.

This is an example module for Chapter 4 of the upcoming book, Learning Drupal 7
Development, by Matt Butcher, Greg Dunlap, Matt Farina, Larry Garfield, Ken
Rickard and John Albin Wilkins.
